# kotobli-database

The biggest challenge with kotobli was data collection. Not all publishers in the SWANA region digitize their books, so it was a big challenge to create a repository with all possible books out there. The data we collected was through coorporation with authors, bookstores, and publishers. We also created crawlers that navigated websites of publishing houses, in addition to manually archiving multiple other collections.

This database is no longer maintained, but please feel free to use it for your future project. It would be awesome if you can contribute your collection as well!
